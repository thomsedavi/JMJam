# JMJam
A sort of experimental program for generating music in JythonMusic using incremental variations. Note I have limited music experience and don't even know if this makes sense.

Update: Well I think there was some kind of potential here but in the end it would have been more work than trying to learn to write music properly, which is what I was trying to avoid.
